# App Name

After Party!

# Criteria Met

This website is a great tool to be able to find events, and hotels in an area, all in one place, so you don't need to waste time searching multiple websites! It is made for music, party, sport, or other event lovers to have easy access to all the information they need. They can search for their favorite performer and find upcoming events and hotels to book near those events.

# Personal Contributions

I contributed by coming up with the idea for the product. Everyone in the group contributed valid and useful ideas, mine was the one that we landed on. I helped to delegate the tasks and to find the APIs we would use. I helped to implement the SeatGeek API. This included the functionality of the search button and the creation of the event cards. This did not include styling the cards. I also helped with overall integration including error managing when overlapping code broke certain areas of code.

# Challenges

My most notable challenge was merging my code with my peer Luis' code. He dealt with the hotel API and cards and I dealt with the event API and cards. When our codes were merged together there were some issues and things that we wanted to streamline accross our code. However, the syntax he used was unfamiliar to me so it was really difficult to identify what was happening in his code and where. We were able to get together and work through it together which solved the issue and taught me some new code.
